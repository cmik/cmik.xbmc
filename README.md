## TFC.tv add-on
This add-on was originally created by Todits (many thanks for his work) and I'm continuing to maintain it (during my freetime) since TFC has released their website beta version and recently their final version by fixing bugs, adding shows/episodes description, banners, using TFC API, etc.... This is first for my personal use (family and friends) but I'm freely sharing my work with the community as you can access your favorite TFC shows and movies from your Kodi platform.

This is not an official TFC.tv add-on but it works with your TFC.tv account as if you were connected to their website.
